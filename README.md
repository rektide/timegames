Timegames is meant to be installed as a daily cron job at the end of your day. It will check your activity feed on github, and if it hasn't been active that day it will make a new commit in a repository and push that commit.

The contents of the commit is a hash from the most recent Public Timestamp Block. By participating in Timegames, you will not only maintain your commit streak, you will also help verify timestamps the world over. Please see http://publictimestamp.org/ for more information on Public Timestamps.
